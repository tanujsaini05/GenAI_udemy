**Advantages of Bag of Words (BoW)**

*Simple and Easy to Implement:* Easy to understand and use, suitable for beginners.
*Good for Basic Tasks:* Works well for text classification, spam detection, and sentiment analysis.
*No Need for Domain Knowledge:* Requires no specialized preprocessing or domain-specific knowledge.
*Compatible with Many Algorithms:* Can be used with most machine learning algorithms.

**Disadvantages of Bag of Words (BoW)**

*Ignores Word Order and Context:* Fails to capture the meaning and context of text.
*High Dimensionality:* Creates large, sparse matrices that are memory-intensive and computationally expensive.
*Sensitive to Common Words:* Frequent words may dominate, even if they carry little meaningful information.
*Fails to Capture Semantics:* Does not consider relationships between words or understand synonyms.
